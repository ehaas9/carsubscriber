## This website is a work in progress

Eventually I'll build **something**

## Tools for personal use

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ehaas9/evanhaas.me/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

### Markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ehaas9/evanhaas.me/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

This page is ultimately my intro to building a clean website where I can blog about cars.
